/* Generic EEPROM driver, manages a block of user data in EEPROM, and does it's best to keep it uncorrupted and verified.
    The user data is managed as an opaque block of RAM, the EEPROM driver doesn't care what is in it.
    A struct contains the definition of the managed data, there is a function for filling this RAM with default data.
    There are only a few API calls:
        eepromDriverInit(block) -- Initialise the block, currently this does nothing. 
        eepromDriverRead(block) -- Read the data from the EEPROM into the RAM. The return code can be used to determine if the data was OK or corrupted.
        eepromDriverSetDefaults(block, arg) -- Set a default set of data to the user RAM. The arg  argument may be used to communicate arbitrary data with the function.  
        eepromDriverWrite(block) -- Write the user data to EEPROM.
*/
